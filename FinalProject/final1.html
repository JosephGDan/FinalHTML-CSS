			<p><b>You have been given a project to design a web page.</b> You have your layout, color schemes, logos, and fonts to represent your brand name and presenation. You are ready to present your page to your clients 
			and need a few rounds of QA to check your site for consistency issues. You have been looking at your site for weeks, no months and likely, your brain is ready to shut down after a long project so you probably won't
			catch those subtle font mismatches or simple div tag that hasn't been closed.</p>
			<p><b>It is a balancing act.</b> You want to create a good looking site for your clients and you want to do it as quickly and efficiently as possible. However, people will notice consistency issues regardless of how hard
			you try to hide it. Consistency is important for web design and how it will affect the look of your page. I have come up with <a href="final2.html">10 Best Practices for Web Development</a> to improve the quality of your site.
			Following these simple rules will help the layout of your page and you will be able to get into a rhythm with your work.</p><br><br>
